				MoodYear puts privacy first for our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use MoodYear. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. <span class="color-accent">IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of MoodYear after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.

			<!-- Collection of info -->
			<p class="content-header color-3 mt-2">Collection of Your Information</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				We collect a limited amount of personal information about you in a few ways. The information we may collect via MoodYear depends on how you use the Application, and includes:
			</p>
			<!-- Table -->
			<div class="flex-full flex-col mt-1 w100 table">
				<!-- Table top -->
				<div class="flex-full flex-row w100 table-row table-top">
					<p class="flex-full flex-ai-fs table-col-1">Collected:</p>
					<p class="flex-full flex-ai-fs table-col-2">Why?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="flex-full flex-row w100 table-row">
					<p class="flex-full flex-ai-fs table-col-1">Email</p>
					<p class="flex-full flex-ai-fs table-col-2">Used to register and login to your account as well as request password changes.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="flex-full flex-row w100 table-row">
					<p class="flex-full flex-ai-fs table-col-1">User ID</p>
					<p class="flex-full flex-ai-fs table-col-2">A unique ID attached to your account that is generated at the time of account creation; only used to further secure your information (NOT device ID).</p>
				</div>

				<div class="flex-full flex-row w100 table-row">
					<p class="flex-full flex-ai-fs table-col-1">Registration Date</p>
					<p class="flex-full flex-ai-fs table-col-2">The date and time at which your account was created. Used for internal reference and displayed on the Account screen.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="flex-full flex-row w100 table-row">
					<p class="flex-full flex-ai-fs table-col-1">Journal Entries</p>
					<p class="flex-full flex-ai-fs table-col-2">Anything you voluntarily enter into your journal entries including the active year, date submitted, mood score, and personalized message. Any optional financial, medical, or other sensitive information you volunteer in your journal entries fall under this category. Used to populate the Application (and the reason you're here!)
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<!-- What we don't collect -->
			<p class="content-header color-5 mt-2">That's It!</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				We do not require nor collect any of the following personal information:
			</p>
			<ul class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>Address</li>
				<li>Location</li>
				<li>Phone Number</li>
				<li>Device Information</li>
				<li>Payment Information</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- How we use your information -->
			<p class="content-header color-3 mt-2">How we Use Your Information</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				First, let's be clear: <span class="color-accent">we DO NOT and will NEVER sell, share, distribute, or disclose ANY of your personal information listed above outside of MoodYear*.</span> To reiterate, MoodYear puts privacy first for our users. How will your data be used, then?
			</p>

			<ul class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				<li>To create and manage your account</li>
				<li>To display your content on MoodYear (your account can only access your own data)</li>
				<li>Internally for analytical purposes (statistics like 'user engagement' to learn how we may improve MoodYear)</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Law -->
			<p class="content-header color-5 mt-2">*Disclosure of Your Information</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				There is <span class="color-accent">ONLY ONE</span> circumstance in which we will disclose your personal information: if a law enforcement agency requests your information <span class="color-accent">AND</span> we are required to do so by law.
			</p>

			<!-- Security -->
			<p class="content-header color-3 mt-2">Security of Your Information</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
			</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				We use Google's own Firebase service to store your information. To learn more about how Firebase secures its information, <a class="link" href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">click here.</a>
			</p>

			<!-- Security -->
			<p class="content-header color-5 mt-2">Account Information</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				By logging into the MoodYear app with your account, you have access to most of your personal information. To see Journal Entries tap the month and then the day you wish to see. To see the Email and Registration Date associated with the account, navigate to the Account screen. We do not display the User ID in the app for security reasons (and as a user, it has no use to you anyways).
			</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				You may terminate your account at any time by logging into your account, tapping the Gear icon in the top right corner, tapping Account, then tapping Delete Account. All of your personal information will be completely deleted from our server. This action cannot be undone.
			</p>

			<!-- Children -->
			<p class="content-header color-3 mt-2">Policy for Children</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
			</p>

			<!-- CA -->
			<p class="content-header color-5 mt-2">California Privacy Rights</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
			</p>
			<p class="content-body color-lite mt-05">
				If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Application, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Application. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Application, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
			</p>
			<p class="content-body color-5 mt-05">
				(The above is legal boilerplate; again, we do not disclose anything to third parties, nor does MoodYear store or display any information publicly. In any case, we extend the same courtesies to our non-Californian users. If you wish to obtain this information, just reach out). 
			</p>
